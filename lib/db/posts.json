By night however, I\nenjoy writing, mostly fiction. When I say &quot;by night&quot;, I don&#39;t mean this in the\nliteral sense, unlike &quot;near-zero&quot; above, which I indeed mean in the strictest\nformal sense of the words. I&#39;m not a natural multitasker. I&#39;ve never really been\nable to do one thing really well during the day and a different thing really\nwell at night. When I&#39;m really writing software, I&#39;m more or less writing it all\nthe time, waking, sleeping, eating, showering, etc., and the same is true of\nwriting fiction. They are all consuming enterprises that seep inexorably into\nall aspects of my life. It&#39;s how I function. Fortunately for me, in the world of\nmodern software development, where check writing is like wish granting in the\nEmerald City of Oz, working this way long enough has gotten me to the point\nwhere I have enough stretches of free time to permit myself being all-consumed\nby writing fiction.</p>\n<div class=\"block max-w-xs float-right p-6\">\n\n<p><picture><source srcset=\"/image/resized/oak/joker-cover-thumb.jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 769px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><source srcset=\"/image/resized/oak/joker-cover-thumb.jpg\" media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><img alt=\"Autobiography of Joker Book Cover\" srcset=\"/image/resized/oak/joker-cover-thumb.jpg\" title=\"Autobiography of Joker Book Cover\" class=\"max-h-screen max-w-screen rounded-md my-6 undefined\"/></picture></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Careful readers may here smell a rat, and they would not be entirely in the\nwrong. But to that I&#39;ll say this: I&#39;m not independently wealthy, I&#39;m not set for\nlife, I have not founded, bootstrapped and sold a cubic zirconian social unicorn\nthat allows me to lounge about like a nineteenth-century gentleman writer,\npenning a few clever lines in between my eleven o&#39;clock breakfast and my\nafternoon salon. In short, I&#39;ve ground away at writing software, like so much\nunglamorous night work, long enough to get reasonably good at it, to the point\nwhere I can charge a decent enough hourly rate for it. Combine this with the\nfact that I don&#39;t spend the proceeds on stupid shit, and this cannot be\nemphasized enough, I don&#39;t <em>necessarily</em> have to do so called night work\nfor the entire duration of the year, minus two weeks vacation and eleven\nfederally sanctioned holidays. That&#39;s all I&#39;ll say about that, unless my\nnear-zero readers clamor for a separate missive on the topic.</p>\n<p><strong>But why?</strong></p>\n<p>Back to the story at hand, the writing of fiction, the publishing of novels and\nrealization of a life&#39;s worth of dreams and aspirations. There is no more\nimportant question here than: <em>why is this the dream</em>? It occurs to me that the\n<em>how</em> is actually of more interest to the pragmatic reader, and I&#39;ll get\nto that in short order, I promise, but we can&#39;t get there, at least not\nproperly, at least not in the same manner that I got there, without first\nanswering the question: <em>why</em>? Why write a novel? Or more generally why\nwrite? Or even more generally: why do anything artistic or creative? Can we do\nit just because it&#39;s fun? By all means do. If it wasn&#39;t fun I wouldn&#39;t do it.\nBut, if it was just for fun I probably would do it less over time, attested to\nby the wasteland of other hobbies that litter my past. Is that why they are\ncalled pastimes? And if it was just for fun I probably would not have gone\nthrough all the trouble (spoiler alert, it&#39;s is <em>a lot</em> of trouble) to\nactually polish and publish the results of all that writing for fun. Can we do\nit for the money? Boy wouldn&#39;t it be nice to have that as an option! If you want\nto do <em>anything</em> for the money, write software, not fiction. Besides,\ndoing <em>anything</em> solely for the money gets boring pretty quick. But maybe\nthat&#39;s just me.</p>\n<p>I write for two reasons, one small and one large. The small reason is that the\nact of creation is immensely rewarding. It&#39;s the same reason I enjoy writing\nsoftware actually. I like to make things. I like to make things up. And, the\nmore control I have over the making the merrier. To state that more formally,\nthe more control one exhibits over a creation, the more emotionally and\nphysically invested one becomes in the process and the more fulfilling the\nfinished product will be, or alternatively, the more devastating the failure.\nWriting software is rewarding to me relative to other potential occupations,\ne.g. teaching (don&#39;t get me started), policing, accounting, scooping ice-cream\nand singing to slavering tourists at Cold Stone Creamery for example. But,\nwriting software can&#39;t hold a candle in the control department to writing\nfiction. <em>Ahem</em>, please don&#39;t ask any of my former colleagues about this.</p>\n<p>Yes, by writing software we can help put satellites into space. We can be\nimpresarios of small business and ringmasters of mid-level enterprises. We can\nsave lives by writing software for dialysis machines, for example, or enable, or\nderail for that matter, democracy by writing software for voting machines. Don&#39;t\nget me wrong, these are all truly awesome, and potentially noble pursuits\n(unless you are writing proprietary voting machine software of course) by which\nwe, as individuals can exert immense control over our practical world and,\nultimately, contribute constructively to civilization.</p>\n<p>But....but...by writing fiction, we get to play at being God. Now that&#39;s\ncreative control. Into the limitless void of the blank page we can open our\nhands and blow a universe entirely of our own making. And while writers with\nmundane commercial aspirations may have to restrict themselves to a certain list\nof rudimentary building materials (vampires, the illuminati, BDSM sex, the\nconflicted emotions of unfulfilled adults), those of us with more far reaching,\nor simply far afield, artistic aspirations can build our worlds with whatever\nelements we see fit. Life needs not be carbon based. Laws of physics need not\napply. You can, if you so choose, make super-intelligent jellyfish the most\npowerful beings in your world. Though, speaking from experience, there may not\nbe an audience for this particular fancy. Of course, just because you can put\nanything into a book, doesn&#39;t mean you should or that people will necessarily\nread it or like it. See Finnegans Wake. In that sense, there are certain laws\nthat apply in the universe of fiction. There needs to be some form of coherency,\nsome form of balance, of continuity, of aesthetic beauty, some organizing\nprinciple that compels a reader to move along from one word to the next. But\nthese laws are highly mutable, ever expanding and contracting and drifting\naccording to the whims of taste and time and culture.</p>\n<p>I guess this is a long-winded way of saying that you get to use your\nimagination. It&#39;s a fair summary and why I say it&#39;s the small reason I write.\nBut that&#39;s not to say it&#39;s unimportant, it&#39;s just personal. It&#39;s an individual\ngratification. But even if that were the only reason, I&#39;d still do it. But it&#39;s\nnot the only reason.</p>\n<div class=\"max-w-xs float-left p-6\">\n\n<p><picture><source srcset=\"/image/resized/maple/taste-and-geometry.jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 769px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><source srcset=\"/image/resized/maple/taste-and-geometry.jpg\" media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><img alt=\"Taste and Geometry\" srcset=\"/image/resized/maple/taste-and-geometry.jpg\" title=\"Taste and Geometry\" class=\"max-h-screen max-w-screen rounded-md my-6 undefined\"/></picture></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>There is a larger reason I write fiction. I say larger because it&#39;s not\nindividual. It&#39;s communal. It&#39;s communication, across both time and space,\nsometimes vast stretches of it. Humanity has been having a semi-formal written\nconversation for five thousand years and I want to have my say in it. This\nconversation is not by definition constructive. It&#39;s never been orderly, fair,\ndemocratic, meritocratic or civil, but it is, nonetheless, an integral part of\nthe fabric of civilization. Right now, sitting at my desk, I can reach over and\ngrab a handful of thin volumes and have a spirited roundtable with Marcus\nAurelius and Holden Caufield and Ignatius J. Reilly and Jake Barnes and after\nonly a little time conversing with these fellows, I&#39;ll know a surprising lot\nabout what it means to be human. After our brief chat I&#39;ll walk away with some\nstartlingly accurate notions of how the world actually works, the good parts and\nthe bad parts and why the good is good and why the bad is bad and I&#39;ll even have\npractical instruction and useful strategies and examples for making the world\nbetter. And, to boot, the conversation will actually be immensely entertaining.\nTo the point where I&#39;ll want to keep on talking, just for the fun of it. Even if\nI may find a particular conversation drool-on-the-desk-boring (Tolstoy) or\nself-aggrandizingly boorish (Bukowski), I&#39;ll probably walk away with something\ninstructive. Joking pot-shots aside, I want to put my two cents into this long\nledger of human accounting. Now I know it&#39;s not the same dimension as\nnuts-and-bolts civilization building, the engineering of aqueducts, the building\nof buildings and bridges and sewers and power grids, but it is still part of the\naccounting. If it&#39;s not exactly making civilization, then it&#39;s making it mean\nsomething. And who knows, now that information has been digitized, this sort of\naccounting might one day be the only evidence of the human experiment that\nremains, after all the concrete manifestations of human existence have been\nground up by time and calamity and fed back into the great furnaces of the\nuniverse.</p>\n<p><strong>&quot;Self&quot; Published</strong> Ok, now that all that hot air has been spent, we can more\neasily steer this dirigible back down to the practical matters at hand: writing\nand publishing the damn novel already.</p>\n<p>Now is also an opportune time for us to clarify a few potentially ambiguous\nterms. Technically speaking, the first novel I published is actually the third\nI&#39;ve written. Also, technically speaking, the novel is self-published. However,\nI did in fact go to the trouble of setting up the minimal legal, marketing and\nbusiness trappings of an actual &quot;Small Press&quot; from which to do the publishing.\nThis included registering an assumed business name, or DBA, for the publishing\ncompany in my state associated with my existing LLC, getting a domain, putting\nup a rudimentary web presence, email, phone, and all the technical sundry of\nwhich I&#39;d be happy to share but they are mundane enough that I won&#39;t unless\nsomeone asks. The result is that my book was technically issued by the\npublisher: <a href=\"https://www.truejokercompany.com/\">True Joker Company</a>.\nAt present, this is a rather thin veneer around Amazon&#39;s print and e-book\npublishing infrastructure. Charitably, I&#39;d say this setup lends an air of\nprofessionalism to the published output and presents some opportunities for\ngrowth into an actual functioning small press in the future, featuring other\nlocal authors and classy, artisanal self-printed offerings. Less charitably, you\ncould call this a vanity press, or worse yet, a digital shell game. If nothing\nelse, I think the company is named appropriately.</p>\n<p>Without further ado, the inaugural release of True Joker Company publications,\nand my first published work, can be found on the publisher&#39;s site\n<a href=\"http:// https://www.truejokercompany.com/#books\" ref=\"nofollow\">here</a>.\nAs already mentioned, the printing and distribution of said work has been\nsub-contracted to various subsidiaries (more on this in a moment) of Amazon and\nis featured\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Joker-Far-Jacob-Heric/dp/0692539506\" ref=\"nofollow\">here\nin print</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Joker-Far-Jacob-Heric-ebook/dp/B018B79GEY/\" ref=\"nofollow\">here\nfor kindle</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How I got there</strong></p>\n<p>I wrote my first book, a science fiction novel, many, many years ago. I wrote\nthat one at nights in earnest, mostly, after the kids had gone to sleep. The\nidea came to me in a dream, literally. It was a classic dystopian near-future\nconcoction. The surface of the earth is wracked by environmental degradation.\nThe majority of earth&#39;s inhabitants have retreated to private cities, in earth&#39;s\norbit, powered by stolen alien technology and the corporate entities that run\nthe cities collectively harvest what remains behind on the surface, both people\nand resources alike, on an almost unimaginable scale. I poured just about\neverything I wanted to say at the time into it and spent a couple years editing\nand then shopping this around to various agents and publishers. Of course, no\none was interested. This didn&#39;t really bother me and I didn&#39;t really work too\nhard at this because, frankly, the business end of the process just wasn&#39;t as\nexciting and enjoyable as the writing, as you can imagine. So I just let it be\nand then wrote the next book while I was on a full-fledged, months long break\nfrom contract software development. This one was the first part of a planned\nscience fiction, fantasy trilogy set in the geologically distant future earth.\nInspired by another dream, this book featured super-evolved animals (upright\nwalking/talking rats, badgers, etc) as well as a dwindling population of humans\nand the aforementioned super-intelligent jellyfish. On the heels of finishing\nthat one I woke up one morning with this odd voice in my head.</p>\n<p>It was a line, a silly line, spoken by a high school kid in an almost alien\nteenage dialect. I wrote the line down immediately and then wrote, more or less\nincessantly, Jack Kerouac style (if you picture Jack Kerouac with children and a\nmortgage), for a few weeks. Then I promptly threw it aside and thought nothing\nof it for a couple years while I did a long software contract. When I picked it\nup those two years later, it was like I was reading someone else. And, I really\nliked it. So much so that I decided to get to work publishing it immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>Expediency in Everything</strong> non-essential to the craft</p>\n<p>Taking stock of the situation, with a raw manuscript in hand, I decided\nimmediately that there was a spectrum of diminishing importance that moved, on\nthe important end, from writing to editing to typesetting to cover design to\npublication and then marketing. This is an aesthetic calculation, of course,\ndesigned to apply the highest value and assign the most resources to ensuring\nthe artistic merit and quality of the thing above all else. Of course leaving\nthe marketing part on the far side of the spectrum of importance makes some\nsense from a chronological perspective, but very little from the point of view\nof someone who actually wants anyone to purchase and read the thing. But, I\nguess, it&#39;s never too late to remedy that and here I am, in fact, doing the\nyeoman&#39;s work of trying to get the word out. Lesson learned.</p>\n<p><strong>Self-editing as seppuku whose success is pyrrhic</strong></p>\n<p>To say that being successful at ritual suicide is a victory not worth the cost\nis redundant to the point of being inane. But, as a metaphor for editing my own\nwork, it is precisely accurate. If you are any good at editing your own work,\nand most people aren&#39;t for obvious reasons, on your first pass you will slash\ngratuitously at any seemingly inessential content in an attempt to get down to\nthe essence. This is the sword to the stomach. So much hard work bled out on the\ncutting floor. Then, gradually the large and dramatic structural and aesthetic\nslashes give way, on subsequent passes, to copy editing and proofreading. Death\nby a thousand cuts. On each pass you find ever more small and obvious errors,\ngoing down in concentric circles unending according to the immutable laws of the\ninferno of literature if not the physical universe. There is no end to it but\nthe non-arbitrary point at which you can no longer stand to even look at this\nthing that at one point was your pride an joy. The pyrrhic victory is that if\nyou are successful at self-editing, you will find your own work revolting. Then\nyou hand the sword off to others and beg for a merciful end to it. I handed mine\noff to friends and family. None of them professionals at the task, but all of\nthem smart and competent and interested. And the price was right.</p>\n<p>I did shop around for an independent professional editor. Turns out the\ntraditional publishing industry being in a state of amazon induced turmoil has\nleft New York city awash in independent editors, most of whom appear to be\nindependent against their better wishes. I almost pulled the trigger on one for\nabout $1500 but, in the end, I just couldn&#39;t figure out how to get to some level\nof aesthetic comfort with this person quickly. So I fell on my sword one more\ntime and resolved to finish the effort myself and with the help of friends and\nfamily. At this point it warrants recalling the lengthy discourse on the small\nand large reasons why I bothered with this endeavor in the first place. Without\nhaving articulated that big picture to myself, I&#39;m not sure I would have seen it\nthrough.</p>\n<p>In the end, <em>Joker</em> is a relatively short work and it has the added benefit of a\nprotagonist who speaks an alien teenage dialect that requires a large amount of\ngrammatical inaccuracy. Unfortunately, my future publications, already underway,\nare substantially longer and feature more conventional narrative voices. I&#39;m\nafraid there will be no getting around professional editing help for those.</p>\n<p><strong>Type setting is a huge time sink</strong> Having an engineering bent, I signed up for\na trial subscription to Adoble&#39;s In Design and began kicking around that beast.\nBeing very impatient to make progress and being an engineer with open source\nproclivities, I switched over to Scribus and began to kick the tires on that as\nwell. Recalling my motto of expediency above all things, I quickly resorted to\nMicrosoft Word and I taught myself enough tricks to typeset a few pages roughly\nand printed the results and pronounced the output professional enough to not\ndetract from the total aesthetic comportment. Of typesetting I&#39;ll say that\ndealing with orphans and widows is an extremely tedious and precarious game of\nfalling dominoes. Whatever total time I spent originally writing the book, I\nspent several multiples on typesetting alone. God forbid you find a significant\nedit during this phase. Restack the dominoes and start again.</p>\n<div class=\"float-right p-6\">\n\n<p><picture><source srcset=\"/image/resized/oak/joker-covers-small.jpg\" media=\"(min-width: 769px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><source srcset=\"/image/resized/oak/joker-covers-small.jpg\" media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><img alt=\"Joker Covers\" srcset=\"/image/resized/oak/joker-covers-small.jpg\" title=\"Joker Covers\" class=\"max-h-screen max-w-screen rounded-md my-6 undefined\"/></picture></p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Cover Art</strong> Here I got lucky. There are two ways to view a book cover. There&#39;s\nthe idiom that you can&#39;t judge a book by it, which, like most other idioms,\nproverbs and conventional wisdom, is demonstrably false. Nothing says\n&quot;self-published&quot; like a shitty cover. So I took the opposite view that the cover\nmust attempt to be a reflective distillation of some important aesthetic quality\nof the contents. Unfortunately for me, unlike editing and typesetting, where\ngrinding hard work and masochism and sleight of hand may suffice to carry the\nday, it is very difficult to fake talent when it comes to the visual arts.\nLuckily I have a very dear friend who does this sort of thing for a living, so I\nwas able to call in a favor, for gratis. Before I talked myself into imposing on\nmy friend for this, I considered advertising a design contest at one of the\nlocal schools and paying the winners something modest. I also considered\ncommissioning more magna doodles from my children (see Ignatius J. Riley above).\nI may resort to these in the future so as not to go back to the friendship well\ntoo many times.</p>\n<p><strong>Create Space and Amazon Kindle Direct publishing</strong> Createspace is easy enough.\nI had my publishing company. I bought some ISBNs to make it official. Muddling\nthrough the forms for publication there makes you feel a bit like you are\nputting together an embarrassing church newsletter that you are sure will not\nproperly goad people into church at all but will instead temp them to stay home\nand use the paper to soak up the excess grease from the Sunday morning bacon.\nBut, the cover and contents themselves are eventually rendered to Createspace in\nPDF format, so you are reasonably assured that the printed output will look more\nor less as you intend. Kindle Direct publishing, on the other hand, features a\nmore professional seeming interface to usher you through the publishing process,\nhowever, despite supporting a variety of formats, including word, html (with a\nbunch of custom amazon tags, most of which kindle doesn&#39;t appear to even\nsupport), mobi, etc., it&#39;s maddeningly difficult to control the formatting of\nthe thing once it hits the actual device. Yes, they have a simulator. However\nwhat I saw in the simulator never matched, even remotely, what I ended up seeing\non the actual device. And that is to say nothing of the preview (or look inside)\nfeature on the amazon book page itself, that never looked anything like what was\nin either the simulator or on the device itself. I bounced back and forth\nbetween html and word and eventually quit and simply stopped when it was good\nenough and it was obvious that I was not going to be able to accurately control\nthe amount of whitespace in a chapter heading without dramatically breaking some\nother aspect of the layout.</p>\n<p><strong>I am on Amazon, I am therefore famous</strong> After ordering a round of printed\nproofs and working painfully through the last few steps again, I pushed the\nbuttons and pointed at amazon and told my children that I was, indeed, a famous\nand accomplished author. I then told them, regretfully, that they could in fact\nNOT read the book as it contained entirely inappropriate content for pre-teens.\nThey took the bad news in stride and beamed with pride and I declared myself\ndone and promptly forgot about it for several months. I mentioned the book to\nsome friends and a bunch bought it and read it and almost everyone who has done\nso has reported back very positively. I take this as evidence that, perhaps, the\nbook may actually have some ineffable and redeeming qualities or, at the very\nleast, as evidence that my friends and associates are both polite and kind. This\nword of mouth has resulted in perhaps a few dozen sales, though it&#39;s hard to\ntell for sure as Kindle Direct Publishing makes it very hard to look at\nhistorical sales numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>A return to marketing, the jokes on me</strong> At long last I saw the light that\nthis process would not be complete unless I take some mysterious and rudimentary\nsteps to market the thing. I began this process, as almost any sane person\nwould, by sitting down at my fine bamboo topped geekdesk and googling myself.\nSure enough, <em>Autobiography of Joker So Far</em>, popped up as a top result. That&#39;s\nsomething. But, wait a minute. My blog was nowhere to be found. My personal\nsite, which I have maintained for about ten years (despite not having an\naudience) and which has sat firmly as the top result when you google me, had\ndisappeared. This was troubling because I had a vague notion that my site was\nsomehow going to be integral to my marketing efforts. I signed up for google\nsearch console and registered my domain and sure enough, I saw this:</p>\n<p><picture><source srcset=\"/image/resized/pine/gibberish.png\" media=\"(min-width: 769px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><source srcset=\"/image/resized/pine/gibberish.png\" media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" type=\"image/jpeg\"/><img alt=\"Google thinks I'm Spam\" srcset=\"/image/resized/pine/gibberish.png\" title=\"Google thinks I'm Spam\" class=\"max-h-screen max-w-screen rounded-md my-6 undefined\"/></picture></p>\n<p>Nothing boosts morale and gets a marketing push off on the right foot like\nsomeone at Google &quot;manually&quot; determining summarily that ten years of idle\nmusings and pictures of my family are probably automatically generated\ngibberish. I&#39;m pure spam. But hey, at least I&#39;m not a victim of some indexing\nbug or change, a human actually thought that about me!</p>\n<p>I requested a review and they reversed the decision within a few days, but, as\nof this writing (a month later) I&#39;m still not indexed despite several requests\nto reindex and a maddening round of feedback on Google&#39;s webmaster forums that\nled me to, more or less, retool my entire web site for fun and self-edification\nbut to absolutely no effect on Google&#39;s search index. For a laugh, see:\n<a href=\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/webmasters/Yhc9bqa6OzM\" title=\"Google&#39;s Webmaster Forums\">post wherein Jacob Heric tries unsuccessfully to get his site re-indexed by google</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Upwards, undaunted</strong> In the end, publishing my first novel and promptly being\ncalled gibberish by the the second largest company in the history of the world\nby market cap is actually a fitting turn of events. A sort of cosmic\nsynchronicity. The situation bears more than a passing resemblance to Joseph K&#39;s\npredicament in Kafka&#39;s <em>The Trial</em>, on whom Joseph Kare (aka Joker) in\n<em>Autobiography of A Joker So Far</em> is loosely based.</p>\n<p>Kafka&#39;s Joseph K wakes up one morning to find himself the subject of lies,\narrested for unknown reasons. He&#39;s set upon by an inscrutable bureaucracy and\nhis life becomes an absurd and darkly comic trial.

I wrote it so my wife and I could have a shared list\nspace for groceries, hardware store runs, etc. No need to text last minute\nadditions. No apps to install. Just add items to the list. Everyone who&#39;s on\nyour unique list url sees the new thing immediately. Swipe left to delete. Swipe\nright to strike out. Touch to edit. That&#39;s it. We&#39;ve been using it heavily and\nit&#39;s really handy. In reality, the app is little more than a conglomeration of\nthe features offered by their nice little suite of demos (with some special\nsauce thrown in). So nothing ground breaking.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p><strong><em>Background</em></strong>: If you haven&#39;t heard of it, Meteor is a\nfrighteningly ambitious full stack web application development framework. Take a\ngander at their <a href=\"http://docs.meteor.com/#sevenprinciples\">Seven\nPrinciples</a> to get an idea of the force and magnitude of their vision. It&#39;s\nessentially beta software (at version 0.5.9 at the time of this writing). But,\nthey&#39;ve got\n<a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Meteor-web-framework/How-is-Meteor-funded-Will-it-be-around-a-couple-of-years-from-now/answer/Mattias-Petter-Johansson?srid=uvTV&share=1\">funding\nand at least some semblance of a plan to produce revenue</a>. Also, the offering\ncurrently has a polish beyond what you might normally expect from beta.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Preview Conclusion</em></strong>: Meteor is a fantastic early stage\nframework that shows great promise and will soon be a great platform candidate\nfor certain types of realtime web apps. It&#39;s probably going to have to throw in\nsome more mobile-centric features (RESTful endpoints on the server, support or\nplugins for every manner of reactive, touch centric UIs, etc.) soon. But I have\nlittle doubt they will.</p>\n<p>Meteor is built on top of <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node</a>, so we&#39;re\ntalking server side javascript, of course. But, Meteor has eschewed\nasych/callback complexities by running server requests in node fibers (one\nthread per request). Some aspects of the framework are sure to delight (or\nterrify) you: database everywhere, reactivity, live html. Database everywhere is\na powerful feature, but one that will likely have to be rebranded a bit to get\nthe sort of adoption they might want in the enterprise (enterprise people don&#39;t\nwant their database everywhere, they want it in one preferably very secure\nlocation). What database everywhere really means (currently) is that data is\nstored in separate but matching collections on the back and front end (mongodb\nand minimongo respectively). If you let it, the framework with broker the\ncollection data back and for automatically for you (you can also lock that\ndown).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://docs.meteor.com/#reactivity\">Reactivity</a> is really a killer\nfeature. Whether or not Meteor eventually gains traction, I suspect this pattern\nwill be adopted widely by other frameworks. After developing a couple small\napplications in Meteor, I consider reactivity a sine qua non feature of web\napplication development. With Meteor, you&#39;ve got reactive datasources backing\nreactive computations backing live html template. This is a very slick way to\ndeliver content realtime to the browser, as you&#39;ll see.</p>\n<p>Yada, yada. Time to show code. Here&#39;s the server side publication of the two\ncollections (lists &amp; things) that the app uses:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jacobheric/5289586.js\"></script>\n\n<p>Straightforward. Note that this code resides in a directory called server, so\nMeteor will not ship this code to the client. The client and the server do share\ncollection notions, so those are declared in a file called model.js and shipped\ndown to the client:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jacobheric/5289606.js\"></script>\n\n<p>Also straightforward. Note that collection security is specified using\njavascript &quot;allow&quot; functions. This feels a little bit awkward at first, but it&#39;s\nprobably better than the alternatives.</p>\n<p>And, here&#39;s the client code that subscribes to the collections published by the\nserver above:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jacobheric/5292339.js\"></script>\n\n<p>A couple of things to note about the things and lists subscriptions. The things\nsubscription is tied to the current list identifier, so you only see relevant\nthings. The list subscription handle (<em>listsHandle</em>) is tied to an empty\nloading div in the DOM. This ensures that the list has been loaded into the\nlocal collection from the server before it is accessed. I picked this handy\nlittle trick up from one of the official examples. It prevents you from getting\nempty collections when accessing them at startup (a source of frustration).</p>\n<p>You&#39;ll see the list handler detects if there is no list. In this case (e.g. you\nland on the naked domain for the first time), it creates one and reroutes the\nrequest to a unique url that corresponds to the list id. Share the url, share\nthe list. The app uses backbone strictly for routing. The router implementation\nis straight from the Meteor examples.</p>\n<p>The <em>template.list.loading</em> declaration is Meteor&#39;s way of supplying data\nto the live html <em>loading</em> div in the <em>list</em> template\n(<a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\">handlebars</a> style).</p>\n<p>Speaking of the view. Here is is in it&#39;s entirety:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jacobheric/5292407.js\"></script>\n\n<p>Not much to it. Some css ensures that the desktop version gets delete/strike out\nlinks instead of just touch gestures. BTW, I added touch/gesture support using\nthe nice, lightweight\n<a href=\"http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/\">hammer.js library</a>. Hammer\nhas been wired up to the list item html element via Meteor&#39;s rendered event so\nthat we can guarantee the element is already in the DOM:</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/jacobheric/5292450.js\"></script>\n\n<p>Also note that we delete the items via <em>Meteor.call(&#39;removeListItem&#39;,\nid)</em>. This demonstrates how to invoke a method on the server rather than\njust deleting the record from the local collection and allowing meteor to\nautomagically propagate that change to the server collection (an operation which\nwe have expressly forbidden via the model allow declaration above).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong>: Even at this early stage, Meteor largely\ndelivers on it&#39;s ambitious promise. I built the first, fully functional version\nof this app in about an hour. I spent more time adding touch/gesture support\nthan I did core features. All in all, Meteor is a very feature rich and polished\nearly stage web development framework offering. It&#39;s an interesting and\ncompelling implementation of a single language stack using server side\njavascript. I can definitely see using it for certain realtime applications in\nthe near future. If they add a few more features (RESTful endpoints,\nmobile-centric UI), then I can see adopting it for a wider variety of\napplications.</p>\n","showMore":true,"excerpt":"<p>Having just rolled off a very long contract, I&#39;ve finally found a little time to\nplay around with new and interesting tech.

You can do a simple iodine test to ensure that this\nconversion has happened.

Technically, I&#39;d advise twice the volume of the water used in the mash.\nIn practice, I just fill up the cooler, more or less.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/19597658\"  webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>The revolving stainless steel sparge arm. This is a handy, but by no means\nnecessary, brew day tool. For a couple years at the outset of all-grain brewing,\nI manually dribbled the water over the grains with a saucepan. It was a labor of\nlove...and a testament to the fact that you can do all-grain brewing with\nnear-zero investment in special equipment. The sparge arm allows me to walk away\nfrom the sparge and play with the kids, get another beer, etc. The idea of the\nsparge is to gently sprinkle water over the grains so that the water runs evenly\nthrough, pulling as much sugar out as possible.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/19596620\"  webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>At the beginning of the sparge I capture the first, grainy runnings in a small\nvessel and add them back on top of the grains. Sparging is a big source of\nanxiety for the new all-grain brewer. But, it&#39;s really much ado about nothing. I\ndon&#39;t recirculate much. Grain in the wort settles out in the boil. A stuck\nsparge is nothing to sweat. I&#39;ve come back to the sparge to find it stuck more\nthan once. A nudge here, an adjustment there. As long as your hot liquor is\ntrickling onto the grains at more or less the same rate that it&#39;s trickling out\nof the lauter tun, and as long as your grains are submerged in water, you&#39;re\nset.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/DPGgWqO9gWt-vwR0PtCWcQ?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh6.ggpht.com/_i9Wevzb14Pc/TUtlfOKmmxI/AAAAAAAADqg/FwP8vso5LFk/s640/IMG_20110130_112635.jpg\" height=\"640\"  /></a></p>\n<p>The unattended sparge.

I keep the lid on until the\nboil gets going. Then it&#39;s off with the lid for a long, vigorous boil. One\nhour...ninety minutes. It depends on how the kids are behaving.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/19595536\"  webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p>The moment the wort comes to a boil is exciting. The sweet wort steam smells\ngreat. A little care is required here to avoid a messy boil over. If you&#39;re\nworried about it, just keep a spray bottle of cold water on hand to knock down a\nrunaway boil. Bittering hops go in early for the long haul. Flavoring hops in\nthe middle of the boil. Some aroma hops at the very end. I try to always have\nwhole leaf hops on hand to throw into the secondary fermenter. There is nothing\nlike dry hopping to make a beer bright and lively.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/EyLToi0Y8nfAaK8fCM5pSw?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh6.ggpht.com/_i9Wevzb14Pc/TUtpWRU5HDI/AAAAAAAADqs/jnQDyQlVsMc/s640/IMG_20110130_121925.jpg\" height=\"443\"  /></a></p>\n<p>More cleaning.

This is the one other brew tool that is indispensable. I can\nrecall some fairly idiotic and ineffective attempts to chill wort without one\nway back when I started. There is simply no way to get wort down to a pitchable\ntemperature quickly without one. The easiest way to sanitize the wort chiller is\nto drop it in the boil for the last ten minutes. That&#39;s a homemade chiller that,\nI think, cost me about 10 bucks to make back when I worked at a hardware\ndistributor and copper was relatively inexpensive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/iDeKsnJ7hVi3LV9wpkJXJw?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh3.ggpht.com/_i9Wevzb14Pc/TUtpX0IIL5I/AAAAAAAADrA/mZifl5qqQak/s640/IMG_20110130_130446.jpg\" height=\"443\"  /></a></p>\n<p>A picture of order and efficiency!

I took an\noriginal gravity reading (for the purpose of calculating the alcohol content\nafter fermentation). This beer turned out to be a big one...weighing in at\n1.058.

I&#39;m not always very diligent about note-taking.\nI went an entire year of brewing without doing that...and without ever taking\nany gravity readings.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m a bit of an odd duck about my brewing philosophy. I don&#39;t believe in brewing\nto styles (IPA, barley wine, etc.). I prefer to brew to senses (taste, smell,\nmouth feel, etc.). I&#39;m also not a big fan of repeatability. I like the variation\nand surprise that comes with whimsical, haphazard brewing. That&#39;s the allure of\nhomebrewing for me in a nutshell right there. You can make whatever the hell you\nwant. You can be original. If things go awry? Who cares.

Fermentation is beautiful.\nYeast life is teeming in there. Alcohol is in the offing. The smells in the\nhouse are invigorating: sweet malt and grassy hop and bready yeast.</p>\n<p>I know I wasn&#39;t super precise about the process. That was on purpose.

A cup of flour for each egg.\nSome olive oil, some salt. Our eggs were small so we did 4 eggs to 3 cups and it\nwas still very dry.

What if you were allowed to hit the pause button on your career,\ntake a break from work during your prime earning years, and just do whatever it\nwas you wanted to do?</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Well, I can&#39;t really answer that truthfully as I didn&#39;t write up a list of\npriorities and then hit the pause button and start checking things off. But, I\nam wrapping up three months away from work and I thought it would be a good time\nto list what it was I did, why I did it and why I think it was important.</p>\n<p>First, a little context. As\n<a href=\"http://www.jacobheric.com/2009/12/22/people-always-mean-well/\">I\nmentioned earlier</a> (apologies in advance for the recapitulation, but it bears\nrepeating), the primary impetus for hitting the pause button in the first place\nwas that my daughter (my four year old) fractured both her tibias in a very\nhalloween appropriate accident in the\n<a href=\"http://www.trails.org/map_files/evergreen_description.html\">fantastic\nEvergreen Cemetery</a> near our house. Long story short, she scurried away from\nher mother (who was occupied chasing down our one year old) and tried to climb a\ntombstone. It toppled on her legs and fractured both her tibias and she spent a\nnight in the hospital and seven weeks in casts. Though it was mortifying (pun\nintended and only possible in light of her full recovery...read on) and\nhorrifying for her and us, she was chipper throughout and handled the ordeal\nwith grace and is now %100 recuperated and back in pre-school and running and\njumping like never before.</p>\n<p>So, I never really made a decision to pause my career. The decision was made for\nme by her accident. And because of that, I am grateful for the accident. This\nsounds weird I know. But I assure you, I wish the accident never happened and I\nwould go back and undo it if I could. But I can&#39;t. I have no choice but to\nconsider it in conjunction with all of its effects and repercussions and process\nit and asses it thus.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Anyway, my daughter broke her legs and I quit my job to take care of her. She\nwas in casts for seven weeks and during that time I was with her almost all day\nalmost every day and we did a whole bunch of stuff together (puzzles, books,\ngames, movies, cooking and lots and lots of trips to the bathroom). I am really\nglad I did this. It was more fun than I thought. It was a lot more work than I\nthought. But it was fun and rewarding and I got to know my daughter really well\nat an important time. Lots of important things are happening when you&#39;re four.\nYou&#39;re starting to piece together your words and numbers, you&#39;re chiseling out a\npersonality, you&#39;re curious as hell about the world and capable and willing to\nspeculate on anything and everything going on around you. You&#39;ve got enough\nquestions to drive any reasonable adult absolutely insane. It&#39;s wonderful. I&#39;m\nthankful that I did it. Which brings me the first thing I did with my three\nmonths and my first priority in life: family.</p>\n<p>Wait you say! Absolutely everybody&#39;s first priority in life is family. Saying\nthat family is your number one priority is a bromide and a platitude. And when\nthe chips are down it means almost nothing. I know, I know. We put our kids in\ndaycare and send them to school and they spend more time with these &quot;strangers&quot;\nthan they do with us and we stuff them full of snacks and stick them in front of\nthe television and we end up being, out of apparent economic necessity, parental\nproxy units whose job number one is to &quot;provide&quot; for our children. And by\n&quot;providing&quot; I mean spending as little time as possible with them while earning\nas much money as possible in order to purchase these aforementioned luxury\nparental proxy services.</p>\n<p>If it sounds like I&#39;ve just gotten all self-righteous and smarmy and\nholier-than-thou, well I haven&#39;t (ok, I admit that last bit was pretty smarmy).\nI&#39;m aiming that last language squarely at myself. I&#39;ve been guilty of this for\nthe first years of my kids&#39; lives and I almost certainly would have continued to\nbe guilty of it if this freak accident didn&#39;t happen and force my hand.\nCircumstance forced my hand. I was presented with a set of unappealing cards. I\nwas terrified of choosing. I dreaded choosing. But, in the end I chose one and\nit was the right one and I am proud that I chose it. The benefits of the choice\nwere immediately obvious. I had this wonderful time with my daughter and I will\ntake from it a measure of contentment in having made the choice and a promise to\nmyself and my younger daughter that I will do the same for her. Having been\nthrough this experience, I believe it&#39;s a promise I can now keep.</p>\n<p>Ok, so that&#39;s a long winded way of saying that I spent some nice time with my\ndaughter and that family is important to me. That&#39;s that.</p>\n<p>Onto work and art and education (hint: those are the other three priorities, if\nyou&#39;re bored, those are an adequate summary and you can take your leave knowing\nthe essentials).</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"http://www.jacobheric.com/2009/12/22/people-always-mean-well/\">\ndiscussed my somewhat complicated relationship to work already</a>. The official\nmotto of my blog (and alternate domain name iprefernotto.org), &quot;I prefer not\nto&quot;, speaks directly to this sentiment. (If you haven&#39;t read\n<a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/129/\">Melville&#39;s Bartley: The Scrivener</a>, go\nread it now). Work, if you like it or feel it is important, will nourish. If\nwork is just something you do. If work is merely that thing that goads you to\naction. Then work will starve you (spoiler alert). You&#39;ll proceed prodded\nthrough life like an unhappy cow and die that way. Or, like the Scrivener, you\nwill put your foot down and do nothing at all and at least have the dignity of\ndying as a man, if an unhappy one.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s a little dramatic. But it&#39;s important. There is a difference between good\nwork and bad work and it&#39;s crucial to figure out how to know good work and to do\nit.</p>\n<p>I have been doing software development and related activities for ten years. For\nthe first few years I found it very exciting. I learned new things every day. I\nbuilt things and felt constructive. And, I saw my work making people&#39;s lives a\nlittle better or a little easier (even if just in the infinitesimal ways that\nsoftware applications can do that). The last few years it began to drag on me.\nThis was partly because software development requires a lot of mental effort and\ninvolves the stresses of deadlines and all the other factors associated with\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/48958/what-causes-developer-burnout\">burnout</a>.\nBut it was also because I have other interests and other goals and dreams and I\nsaw them falling by the wayside for lack of effort while at the same time I\nexpended huge amounts of energy at work.</p>\n<p>Well, the feeling of impending burnout had actually got me started taking\ncorrective steps well before my daughter&#39;s accident. I enrolled in a part time\nonline masters program in education. I had completed a few courses and was on\ntrack (and still am) to receive a Masters of Science in Education at the end\nof 2011. And, I had started writing. By the time of my daughters accident I had\nmanaged to churn out the first fifty pages of the long-imagined novel. I did\nthis in the nooks and crannies between work and dinner and bedtime rituals and\nall the middle of the night ordeals (my youngest is still one).</p>\n<p>So, there I was, I knew learning and education were important to me, I knew I\ndreamt of writing and I managed to articulate that and formulate a plan and I\nwas actually doing them, if only on nights and weekends. But I was still\nexhausted and unsatisfied and feeling like that cow prodded out of the house\nevery morning.</p>\n<p>But then of course the accident happened and I found myself with the time to\nreally dig into my classes and the time to really dig into writing the book and\nI felt the rejuvenating effects of doing good work. Good work begets more good\nwork. I don&#39;t know how or why but it does. I&#39;m pretty sure it has something to\ndo with relevance and the ability to make simple connections between what you&#39;re\nworking on and things in your life that are important to you. I see it in my\ncourses where I&#39;m learning about development and how kids learn and I see these\nthings playing out before me in my girls. I&#39;m writing fiction, but what I write\nis a direct expression of things I feel and think every day.</p>\n<p>Now I&#39;ve nearly wrapped up the book and I&#39;ve even added a class that has nothing\nto do with my degree program (yay for philosophy) and I find myself interested\nin and actually wanting to do (and doing at night now, more on this soon)\nsoftware development for fun and I feel like there is ample time and I have\nample energy to get all this stuff done.</p>\n<p>This takes me back to a conversation I had with my boss as I wrapped up my last\ngig after the accident. We were trying to hammer out an arrangement for me to\nstay at work while my daughter recovered and he asked me what my priorities were\nand he wanted to know where work was on that list. And I said:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Family</li>\n<li>Education</li>\n<li>Work</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If I had thought about it longer I may have added writing or art to the list but\nthat is really just work to me. It is the best expression of good work and it is\nthe culmination of cherishing loved ones (family) and learning (education, both\nformal and informal) and the result of other good work.</p>\n<p>Ok, so this has gotten a little feel-goody-oprahesque for my taste. I have just\na little more to say on the matter (for now anyway). I get this question a lot:\nso do you want to be a developer or a teacher? I assert my answer is yes and\nyes. This is really difficult for people to hear, they want to know precisely\nwhat your profession is and they want to know it now. I don&#39;t just mean this as\nan exercise in cognitive dissonance. I view education as a lifelong endeavor\nworthy of pursuit always and everywhere (in the kitchen and in college, so to\nspeak). Education to me is not just about deepening expertise in a particular\narea (e.g. your vocational field), it&#39;s about deepening your understanding of\nyourself and the world. I will change vocations surely. Vocations will change\nunder me dramatically (don&#39;t get me started on\n<a href=\"http://www.jacobheric.com/2009/12/19/fragmented-java-web-development/\">that\ntopic</a>). At the end of 2011, I&#39;ll have a Masters Degree in Education and a\ncertification and will have to choose between being a teacher or being a\ndeveloper (or choose to be both). In either case I&#39;ll have a tremendous amount\nof information and expertise to compare across disciplines and bring to bear on\neither pursuit. When I get there, I&#39;ll be happy to choose and happy to have\ngiven myself the choice. Be sure I&#39;ll be choosing good work. Also be sure I&#39;ll\nbe setting myself up to make another choice a few years hence.</p>\n<p>So that was my three months: family, education and work. The family and\neducation part were easy, almost inborn. The work part was rejuvenating (is\nrevelatory too strong a word?). I got back to good work. I remembered what it\nwas like to do it. I figured out how to know it. I set myself on a course to do\nit again for a long time.</p>\n","showMore":true,"excerpt":"<p>What would you do if you were given three months off to do whatever it was you\nwanted to do?

By putting these thoughts down, I hope to forge a\nlittle more of a formal idea of what I&#39;m looking for the next time I run into\nnew talent and have to assess it and work with it.</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the reality is you&#39;re never really going to know what you&#39;ve got\nuntil you&#39;re working with a developer and you see him or her make that first\ncritical decision in the project pressure cooker. Interviews help and code\nsamples are great, but they are pretty highly controlled artifacts and evidence.\nThey&#39;re <em>in vitro</em>, not <em>in vivo</em>. Real life conditions for a\ndeveloper are fractious. Deadlines loom, clients transmogrify, PMs hound and\nevery developer action gets instantly tabulated in the ledger of present and\nfuture cost (how much\n<a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html\">technical debt</a>\ndid you just incur when made that lousy decision?).</p>\n<p>Here are my few short and broad characteristics of good devs. I&#39;ll follow up\nwith a little discussion of how to spot these traits and why they are important.\nIt might not be possible to know for sure you&#39;ve got a good developer until\nyou&#39;ve worked with them, but it&#39;s imperative that you know before you&#39;re tearing\nout a third of your code base a month before your deadline.</p>\n<p>A good Java developer...</p>\n<pre><code>- Has varied experience kept at an arm&#39;s length.&lt;/li&gt;\n- Has curiosity plus adaptability.&lt;/li&gt;\n- Communicates persuasively.&lt;/li&gt;\n- Prefers simplicity to novelty.&lt;/li&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Experience is essential. How much? 5 years? 10? I&#39;ll take a dev with five years\nof experience on five substantially different projects over a dev with 10 years\nof experience working in one environment. I want a developer that has strong\nideas about the right way to do things, not a strong opinion about a particular\nway of doing things. A developer that looks at a problem and makes a decision on\nthe best way to solve it is usually a developer who has solved it a few\ndifferent ways in the past. A developer who sees a problem and immediately grabs\na chunk of code and says &quot;here&#39;s how we did that&quot; is going to put a lot of code\nin your project that is going to get ripped out. Who does that? A developer who\nhas logged 16,000 hours JDBC programming, for example, is going to do that\nbecause they have long ago stopped thinking about how to get data from the\ndatabase (in order to preserve their sanity). A developer who has implemented a\ncouple different ORM providers, used Spring&#39;s JDBC template and done straight\nJDBC programming (in reverse chronological order) is much more likely to have\nideas about how to do data access in their tool belt rather than specific data\naccess implementations.</p>\n<p>The later developer with more diverse experience is also going to carry a\nhealthy skepticism about past implementations. They are going to keep those at\narms length because they&#39;ve had the opportunity to compare them to different\napproaches which inevitably highlights shortcomings.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to curiosity and adaptability. Varied experience sets the stage\nfor curiosity. If you&#39;ve done something three different ways you&#39;re much more\nlikely to be curious and looking to find a fourth way that encompasses the best\nof the previous three and adds the missing salt. You&#39;re also much more likely to\nfind and consider radically different or breakthrough approaches (which carry\nthe potential for huge time savings or jumps in profitability). Have you done\nyears of SQL, HQL &amp; EJB QL? Then you&#39;re probably going know when to try\nNoSQL! Have you done JSF and used half dozen Javascript AJAX libraries? Then\nyou&#39;re probably going to know when it&#39;s time to try FLEX.</p>\n<p>But you can&#39;t switch to a new technology unless you&#39;re able to articulate\n(especially in writing) specific advantages. This almost always boil down to an\neffective outline of short or long term cost and time savings. And, you need to\nbe able to do this to a variety of audiences: non-technical clients, managers,\nPMs and your dev peers. Being able to write a persuasive argument doesn&#39;t just\ndemonstrates a certain quality or refinement of thinking, it demonstrates an\nability to know and listen to an audience. A good developer doesn&#39;t just know\ntheir audience, he or she is sensitive to their interests and capable of\ntailoring communications to them. You can start to feel developers out on this\nfront from the first email resume submission. Look for emails and dialogue that\ndemonstrate even and measured assessment of technology rather than singular\nendorsements based on recent personal experience. An average dev will tell you\nthat they&#39;ve built an app using Ext GWT, a better dev will offer an opinion\nabout when it&#39;s appropriate to use Ext GWT and probably have a short list of\npros and cons to offer off the top of their head.</p>\n<p>The last and most important attribute of a good Java developer (or any developer\nfor that matter) is a proclivity for simplicity. Simple code is maintainable\ncode. Maintainable code is good code. You can usually see this in code samples.\nAre methods discrete and short as possible? Is the formatting and syntax\nconsistent? Does the code tell you clearly what it&#39;s doing and do the comments\ntell you consistently why? You can spot the habits of good developers in the\nsimplest of things. Does code use the Java 5 for-each construct here and an\niterator there? Is the StringUtils being used in one spot and a custom algorithm\nin another? That&#39;s a dev who&#39;s discovered a new way of doing something and\nswitched to it without switching it everywhere. That&#39;s also a maintenance\nproblem. Simplicity with an eye towards maintainability is an especially\nimportant attribute for a developer who does your framework selection. A good\ndeveloper won&#39;t put a framework into the mix until they know how to use it and\nare confident that there are time and maintenance advantages.</p>\n<p>If you talk to a developer, look at their resume, check out their code and work\nwith them even just a little bit, you&#39;ll see pretty quickly whether or not they\npossess or have the potential to possess these attributes. If they do, you&#39;ve\ngot a good developer or a good developer in the making on your hands.</p>\n","showMore":true,"excerpt":"<p>I&#39;m not going to offer anything groundbreaking here.

He said it in the parlor scene as Marion\nnibbled on sandwiches, taxidermy looming, and politely suggested that Norman put\nhis mother in the madhouse.

And Anthony Perkins delivers it so well that it\nactually becomes an attractive sentiment. It reminds me of a sentiment delivered\nby Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. &quot;I can&#39;t keep\ndoing this on my own with\nthese...<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3THVbr4hlY#t=1m43s\">people</a>.&quot;\nIt&#39;s another great line, delivered so well that you can&#39;t help but get behind\nit, that leaves very little to doubt about its ultimate expression. By the time\nit&#39;s realized in Plainview&#39;s personal bowling alley at the end of the movie,\nyou&#39;re all but rooting for that pin to drop on Eli&#39;s head.</p>\n<p>On September 21st, my daughter broke both her legs when she tried to climb up a\ntombstone in the cemetery by our house. The stone toppled and she suffered\nbilateral tibial fractures that put her in casts for about seven weeks. I was\nworking full time and taking three graduate courses in education when it\nhappened and I decided, immediately, that something had to go. So I quit my job\nto take care of her while taking my classes.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve had plenty of awkward conversations since that moment. Not about my\ndaughter breaking her legs. Those have all been straight forward. People are\nhorrified and sympathetic, in very short order. But when I tell them that I quit\nmy job, that&#39;s when the clucking usually begins. A father of two with a mortgage\nquits his job in this recession, that&#39;s interesting. One thing I&#39;ve noticed is\nthat people stand very little chance of masking their feelings no matter how\ndelicately they put their thoughts.</p>\n<p>The other thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the reactions cut differently depending on\ngeneration. People my age, who&#39;ve seen at least a dozen jobs and felt apparent\nlittle love for any of them, all came back with with an emphatic &#39;meh&#39; or a\njealous confession of a desire to do the same thing. The boomers are the real\ncluckers, they say a few polite things but all of them look at me like I&#39;m\ninsane. People who saw or lived within shouting distance of the great depression\nseem to harbor a very real concern that my children may starve. One very\ncharming lady at a neighborhood girl&#39;s birthday party offered us canned beans\nfrom her basement when my wife told her that I had quit my job. It&#39;s an\ninteresting, if flimsy, generational core sample of our evolving ideas about\nwork.</p>\n<p>All and all, it&#39;s been a great three months concentrating on my family and\nschool and myself. It&#39;s been a wonderful exercise of my priorities and good\nopportunity to work on my perspective.</p>\n","showMore":true,"excerpt":"<p>&quot;People always mean well.

Almost all insoluble troubles in\nlife can be traced directly back to a moment when you confronted discomfort\nand you responded by lying to forestall that discomfort. Discomfort\nforestalled metastasizes. The way to avoid this problem is to notice\ndiscomfort. When you feel uncomfortable, don&#39;t measure your words and\nthoughts, just say them. Always walk directly into awkwardness. This activity\nwill seem against your instinct. But life itself is a persistence against an\ninstinct (the instinct not to be). Acceptance of discomfort dissipates\ndiscomfort. Honesty is the path to dissipation. Honesty is happiness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Do not fear poverty.</strong> Nearly every aspect of your popular culture will\nimply or insist that your value is directly related to the amount of money or\nthings you possess. Money and things have no bearing on your worth or value as\ncitizen and a human being. Your value as a citizen, as a member of\ncivilization and as a human can be measured fairly simply by your thoughts and\nactions as they contribute to or detract from the well being of your\ncommunity. In a culture infested with cupidity, willful poverty is the\nentrance to a quality life. If you resist materialism alone, you are a\nsuccess, for everywhere else resistance to being good is less.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Do not fear loss and death.</strong> A life that does not end is meaningless.\nEternity, in any form, would be unbearable. Every moment lived is a moment\nlost. Death is not the culmination of life but the process of living. Living\nis dying. If you can notice this as things go, as you lose them, you will find\na measure of contentment. Losing yourself, letting go and living are synonyms\nfor death. Though this is simple, I have not explained it well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Take responsibility for your superstitions.</strong> There are as many\nsuperstitions as there are people. For instance, god is a superstition.\nSuperstitions are often necessary palliatives to make life endurable. They are\nnot to be shunned or extirpated, only identified. Allow them to help you but\nname them for what they are: little helpers. Take responsibility for your\nlittle helpers. They are of your making and for your benefit. They have no\nintrinsic value and you should not try to attribute their value to any broader\ntruth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Do not be precious.</strong> Do not take offense easily. Do not obsess over\ncleanliness or order. Start here: do not be a picky eater. It&#39;s a small but\nimportant way to realize that your proclivities, your likes and dislikes,\nthough they seem most elemental, they are really just arbitrary. They don&#39;t\ndefine you. Though the strides you make with food may be small, they are\nubiquitous, they amount to big change. If you can change what you like to eat,\nyou can change your mind and behavior. You can do anything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Maintain your dignity when in a ditch.</strong> It goes without saying (therefore\nit is said often) that your character is measured by it&#39;s exercise in\ndifficult times. However it is not often said (and therefore bears saying)\nthat a dignified janitor has more dignity than a dignified statesman. It is\nhardest to have and demonstrate character when you are in a position that\ndemands no respect. Go out of your way to show respect to those that\ndemonstrate it despite a lack of station. Try your hardest to be decent when\nyour station is low.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Dance and sing.</strong> Art is the highest human accomplishment. It is essential\nto happiness. While it may not be possible for you to express yourself in the\n&quot;high&quot; forms that garner collective accolades and that are canonized, you can\ndance and sing. When you dance and sing, you are making art, you are\nexpressing yourself in an essential way. You are exercising your humanness.\nYou will be happier for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Praise doubt and doubt praise.</strong> Doubt in the face of consensus is always\nwise. And, there is hardly a surer sign of wrongness than a consensus of\nesteem. Respect authority and expertise, they are necessary for the\ntransmission of knowledge. But be skeptical of authority and expertise, you\ncannot learn unless you doubt what you are given. With measured praise, you\nwill acquire knowledge. With careful doubt, you will add to it. Both of these\nare hard as they require some self directed thinking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Be curious and kind.</strong> Learning makes us better. Curiosity is its means.\nKindness is its method. Be curious about the world around you, animate and\ninanimate. Prod people and things, you will find out how they work. By knowing\nhow the world works, you will be a better person to live in it. By knowing how\npeople work, you will be a better person to live with.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Be polite.</strong> Please and thank you make the world go round, literally. It is\none of the first things you will learn in life, and if you practice it\nthroughout, you will have lived well and will leave the world a better place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Laugh at everything, including this.</strong> There are no things in life that are\ntoo big, too small, too high minded, too sad or too sacred to laugh at. So\nstart here. Laugh at my poor grammar, it&#39;s funny. Laugh at my false certainty,\nit&#39;s funny. Laugh at my glaring presumptuousness, it&#39;s funny. Laugh at my\nutter failure with regard to each of these, that too is funny. Also, don&#39;t\nforget to laugh at yourself. I&#39;m laughing at you now because here you are at\nthe end (you didn&#39;t skip any did you?). I managed to transfer these to you.\nThey are now yours, and that&#39;s funny to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","showMore":true,"excerpt":"<p>These are the things I hope to teach my kids, mostly by example, over the course\nof their lives.

Having had\nmy weak American beer. Not out of thirst or hunger. But in the quiet of the\nself-balancing night. Where I am outside my occupation. Where everything is less\nimportant than I thought.

I contains one of those classic scriptural tidbits that\nare absolutely compelling. Powerful rhetoric, beautiful to envision if only\nbecause it is demonstrably false everywhere in real life: &quot;There are last which\nshall be first, and there are first which shall be last.&quot; It&#39;s the usual bit\nabout getting into heaven...where there are rewards for those who have nothing\nor foresake everything in life. There was even a doorman:</p>\n<div style=\"padding: 5px;\">\"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.

In it, he&#39;s trying to hire a ticket\nseller/taker by mail. (I haven&#39;t tracked down the audio for this bit online yet,\nif I do, I&#39;ll update this post. It&#39;s on a discography I have called\n<a href=\"http://www.answers.com/topic/let-the-buyer-beware?cat=entertainment\"><strong>Let\nthe Buyer Beware</strong></a>). He wonders if the ticket seller would also be\navailable for &quot;companionship&quot; and warns that the seller will likely have to deal\nwith his psychotic (and fake, or at least borrowed from the news) father who\nshows up at shows and throws feces in the seller&#39;s face or leans against the the\nticket booth, naked, with a sign tied to his unmentionables announcing that the\nticket seller will &quot;Kiss it&quot; when we hit $1,500 in sales.</p>\n<p>If heaven is anything like I imagine, there must be an awful lot of that going\non around the front door.</p>\n","showMore":true,"excerpt":"<p>I went to church on Sunday with my wife and daughter.
