We had a weekend away at the Algonquin Hotel in St. Andrews by The Sea in New
Brunswick Canada. Think dirty dancing meets the shinning. It had an abundance of
times-gone-by charm.

The hotel had a sprawling veranda outside and a causeway inside where we played
chess and had cocktails.

It was a short walk from the hotel to the town, which sits on Passamaquoddy Bay.

We visited the
[Fundy Discovery Aquarium](https://www.huntsmanmarine.ca/aquarium) which was
very strangely taken over by pirates for the day.

They even gave us pirate names.

Speaking of pirates, the town had a distinct seaside Popeye quality to it. Here
the buildings bend in an almost cartoonish fashion.

The town was virtually overrun with these little guys.

Canadians really love to smoke butts.

We did some shopping and bought some records.

I did a bit of sleuthing to try to determine what birds where crying incessantly
outside our hotel window. The
[Merlin Bird ID](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) app told me it was a
sharp-shinned hawk. The bellhops told me the cry was artificial and piped in to
keep the pigeons off the balconies. Sure enough, I found the speakers.
