We took a little trip with friends to Quebec. We spent time in Montreal, Quebec City and further north in Baie-Saint-Paul.

Our rental in Baie-Saint-Paul was stunning. It was our first visit to Montreal. We've been to Quebec City before and I can't
wait to go there again. There is really nothing like it in North America.
