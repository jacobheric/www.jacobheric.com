That first ride is the best ride. I pulled the drive train off the little green
bike (the "magna", thanks China) and Rosa tooled around without pedals for a few
days. Balance. Then I popped 'em back on and away she went. Well, first she rode
a few cautious feet in the driveway (repeat 47 times). Then she took the show
into the road where she melted down with desire and frustration to do it on her
own. Then, we tried in front of our friend Josh's house (who took the video,
thanks Josh). As you can see the grade was perfect. She picked her feet up and
went.\
The smile was big and the pride was priceless and she has not stopped pedaling
since. Later that night she asked me, "what do you think about me riding on two
wheels?" I think it's about perfect.
