Mom's school started a couple weeks before Rosa's, so we had to get creative
with kid coverage. I took only a couple days (thanks to nana) but managed to
cram the days so full of little adventures that it was a summer send-off to
remember. We rode bikes downtown (May's first big ride on the two
wheeler...three miles). Got Maine peaches and red plums at farmers market. Went
book shopping. Baked a cake. Made a chicken pot pie (Rosa's request). Rode the
city bus twice. And, we squeezed in a trip the Thirsty Pig for beers and
sausage!
