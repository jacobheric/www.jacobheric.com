Looks like the previous reader of my library book narrowly avoided disaster. The
book, by the way, was
<em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26530383-the-dream-of-reason" title="I Dream of Reason Book" rel=“nofollow”>The
Dream of Reason: A History of Philosophy from the Greeks to the
Renaissance</a></em> by Anthony Gottlieb. Which, incidentally, despite the prior
patron apparently falling asleep while reading it, is brisk and entertaining.
