We biked over Veteran's bridge to [Lincoln & Maine](https://lincolnandmain.net/). It's a good example of where
greater Portland Maine is in terms of development. It's an electric bike shop, bagel cafe and vermouth distillery!
Not quite Portland or Austin level weird, but getting there.

Bagels are from the [Bread + Butter Catering Company](https://www.breadandbuttercompany.com). They are
a real treat for us as they are the same owners as the now closed 158 Picket St Cafe that we used to haunt...
many pictures of which you'll find in these pages.
