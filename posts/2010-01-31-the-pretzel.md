I made pretzels for last week's Vikings Saints game. We had a bunch of people
over and ate wings and drank beer and had an all american family afternoon. My
(almost) two year old daughter calls these events "sissaball parties." I have
know idea why she does this, but the name is a strangely appropriate way to
describe a sport that features so many towering, corpulent hulks. So it stuck
and now we feature regular sissaball parties.

These events are usually more about camaraderie and revelry (and of course
drinking beer), but last week's game had a little more sporting intrigue for me
and my friend Josh since we are both Wisconsin transplants, which makes the
specter of Brett Favre playing for a super bowl in a Viking's uniform a
genetically compelling phenomenon. I took the long (and non-sporting) view and
saw Favre's betrayal as a rite of passage into retirement and oblivion for Mr.
Favre. I rallied to his cause and forgave him his trespass knowing that I might
some day find myself in a similar position and need leeway for similar
transgressions. This is not kosher in Wisconsin, where
<a href="http://www.lacrossetribune.com/news/local/article_b8f7f1ea-9124-11de-b4c0-001cc4c03286.html">Favre
is largely considered a goat</a> for landing at the rival Vikings. My sentiments
were also not kosher with Josh. The result was an awkward
<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=astleford/100122&sportCat=nfl">odd-coupling
of our usually aligned sporting interests.</a>

So, I extended the olive branch of homemade pretzels (Josh said there was
nothing like a big, soft pretzel). They were a lot of work. Though not as much
as killing and cooking a 300 pound boar, I presume (see second link above). And,
I don't think that I would do it again. I think you're supposed to make pretzels
with sodium hydroxide. But you can't really get that at the store anymore (I
know, I tried to pick some up to make soap recently and the guy told me that
it's used in meth labs so they don't sell it anymore). I resorted to baking
soda, which was a lot less fun and dangerous. But, the results tasted pretty
good and were well received. For the super bowl, we're planning something that's
a little less work, if not exactly traditional: fish and chips.

Sorry for the poor pic quality, I couldn't be bothered to find the camera and
just used photo booth. Also, the beer is obviously there to show scale.
