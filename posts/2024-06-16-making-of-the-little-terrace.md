The
[Memorial Union Terrace](https://union.wisc.edu/visit/terrace-at-the-memorial-union/)
on my old campus is one of my favorite places in the world. But it is also half
a world away from where I live. So this summer I decided to recreate it with a
"Little Terrace" here in Maine.

Might as well break it in with a proper bbq. Probalby should have paired it with
beer and bratwurst.
