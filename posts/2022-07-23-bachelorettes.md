When the summer heat finally hits Portland, we invariably hit the side deck at
[Flatbread](https://flatbreadcompany.com/locations/portland-me/) for a cold one
and a cool ocean breeze. Watching the bachelorettes come and go on the pedal
boat (see in the background) has also become an endearing pastime.
