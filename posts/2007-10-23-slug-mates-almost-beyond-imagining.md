Given their frequency, why shouldn't two of my first five posts be about slugs?

This is a clip from the BBC's and David Attenborough's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_in_the_Undergrowth">Life in the
Undergrowth</a>, which we've just begun to watch. It's a fascinating series
that's as much about film gadgetry as invertebrates and that, as such,
disappoints some for it's lack of detail. These are Leopard Slugs mating. As I
mentioned before, they're hermaphrodites. Which becomes evident towards the end
of the clip in a luminescent, fanning, intertwined genital sort of way. I can't
tell if Attenborough's narrations are profound in their accuracy and simplicity
or if I'm just beguiled by the british accent ("AlGae"), the flyaway white hair
and the apprehension that the teetering narrator will collapse in the desert and
describe, awestruck and wistful, what it's like to be overrun by a swarm of
stinging scorpions.

I'm not sure how the BBC feels about its content being on you tube. The video
and info on their
<a
href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/lifeintheundergrowth/video.shtml">site</a>
is much better. I just can't embed their videos in my posts.
