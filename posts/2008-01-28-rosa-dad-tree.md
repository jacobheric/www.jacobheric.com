This year was especially accommodating for the annual tree gathering adventure
due to copious amounts of snow. Even the sign that reminds us where to turn was
buried in snow, which caused us to drive an extra 30 miles in the wrong
direction (every turn looking more like the last). But, no matter, we eventually
got there and bagged a beautiful tree. It helped that it was completely covered
in snow so we couldn't see what it really looked like until we got it home.
There, it turned out strangely symmetrical.
