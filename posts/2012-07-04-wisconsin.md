We did a fourth of July trip to the old homefront and great state of Wisconsin.  It was fantastic (sweltering weather not withstanding).  We spent some quality time in Milwaukee.  Rocked out in Waukesha (home of Les Paul guitars).  Ate some custard.  And made rare use of my lifetime membership to the Wisconsin Memorial Union at my Alma Mater the University of Wisconsin Madison.
