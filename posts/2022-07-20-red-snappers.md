In one of the more wonderfully goofy minor league baseball traditions, the
Portland Sea Dogs transform into the
[Maine Red Snappers](https://www.milb.com/portland/team/maine-red-snappers) once
a year to celebrate Maine's signature hot dog style. I grabbed a shirt to
commemorate the day. For the record they also play as the
[Bean Suppahs](https://www.milb.com/portland/team/maine-bean-suppahs).
