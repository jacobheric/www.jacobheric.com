The wife and kids snuck away to Presque Isle to spend some quality summer
vacation time with the family. I've stayed behind trying to use some
kid-free-nights to catch up on outstanding project work from the last two
semesters (yes, I'm two semesters behind on my school work). I wrapped up last
semester tonight and hope to wrap up last spring tomorrow. I was hoping to
squeeze in some homework from my present semester, but I'm just too tired. One
of the reasons I'm too tired is that I decided to walk to and from work today.
This is part of my master plan to deal with my punishing work and school
schedule using the counterintuitive time management strategy of taking MORE time
to commute to work rather than less. My reasoning is that time spent walking is
more conducive to thinking (more so than driving a car or biking) and that an
extra two hours per day dedicated to nothing more than extended, solitary
meditation will improve my mental health. I surmise that improved mental health
coupled with this extended meditation time will make me more productive at work
and school, not less. I'll be figuring things out all the while, walking and
thinking of new ways to do things and whatnot. After all, Thomas Jefferson could
not have been mistaken when he said
"<a href="http://www.kadavy.net/blog/posts/thomas-jefferson-on-walking/">There
is no habit you will value so much as that of walking far without fatigue</a>."
It all sounds good. But I'm too damn tired tonight to realize any
extra-homework-productivity.

If nothing else, a long walk through the city does allow you to spot hidden gems
that you'd never see on bike or in the car. I ran into this wonderful graffiti
on the back of the old Wild Oats (soon to be Trader Joes) building just off of
Marginal Way. It's a nifty stencil of kissing bird-men ascribed with the elegant
and defiant "fags". At first glance I thought it was flying monkeys from the
Wizard of Oz (I've seen that movie more than my fair share with the 2 &amp; 5
year olds). Once I puzzled it out, I couldn't help but think of a
<a href="http://www.kweer.com/homer/brucelancejulien.wav">choice quote from
Homer Simpson</a> on the topic. A very nice find. I marked it (more or less) on
the map of my walk route (see point B on the map after the fold).
