The sun carves such a shallow arc through the northern winter sky that it is
necessary to get out and savor it as much as possible. Here it rises over
[House Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Island_(Maine)) in Casco Bay,
as seen from
[Fort Allen Park](https://www.portlandmaine.gov/2236/Fort-Allen-Park).

And in the early afternoon it struggles to stay above the treeline, as seen
snowhoeing at the Riverside Golf Course.
