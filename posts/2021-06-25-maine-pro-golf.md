On the return trip from Bethel, we hit the inaugural Live + Work in Maine Open.
It's a new stop on the Korn Ferry tour. Here I chat up a professional caddy
nicknamed "Shaggy" after his round. He walked me through the tools of the trade
and invited us down to Brookline, MA where he loops for a living and where the
US Open will be played in 2022.

Decked out in my best golf nerd attire

I found a kindred spirit in golfer Bobby Bai who sported the Jolly Roger.
