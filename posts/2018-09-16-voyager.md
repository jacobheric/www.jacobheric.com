I love everything about the
[Voyager](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/index.html) mission. The
transcendent hopefulness, the technological audacity, the sheer will to reach
beyond ourselves. I jumped when I stumbled on a
[kickstarter](https://ozmarecords.com/pages/voyager) to issue a vinyl replica of
Voyager's [golden record](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/golden-record/) cargo.
