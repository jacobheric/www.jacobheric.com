After lazily living life offline for the last many months (I have a family for
chrissake), I've decided to dip the toe back
<a href="http://www.iprefernotto.org/node/174">in</a> and see how it feels. As
you see, I've included video evidence that life has indeed been going on (more
evidence <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/jacobheric">here</a>) erstwhile.
But, I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I was actually online more than not
compulsively checking sites like Nate Silver's
<a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/">fivethirtyeight.com</a>. I loved your
site to death Mr. Silver, but I really don't want to see another poll for at
least two years. Thankfully that mania had a happy ending. It was a frantic,
exhausting and ultimately cathartic heave-ho to the dark Bush years. I hope an
Obama administration can
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Funding_Accountability_and_Transparency_Act_of_2006">shine</a>
enough light onto government to prevent a lapse into another mini dark age in
our lifetimes.

I'll look forward to posting again in another year (I'm only half joking).
