We took a meandering trip through western Maine this summer. Stopped off at
Bissel's Three Rivers Brewery in Milo. The gleaming setup in the pictures should
give you some indication of the extent of the craft brew boom happening in
Maine. This is in a town of 2,500 people an hour outside of Bangor and two and a
half hours outside of Portland.

We hiked nearby

and ran into a treasure trove of mushrooms!

We ventured even further west to Greenville. Here's the lovely view from our B&B
porch.
