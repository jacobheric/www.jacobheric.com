Ran across a blacksmith yesterday who set up shop with a portable forge in
Monument Square in Portland. He narrated as he worked and fielded questions with
alacrity. It was fascinating to watch. Apparently he was there for Portland's
<a href="http://www.liveworkportland.org/arts/walk">first friday art walk</a>.

He's from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePortlandForge">Portland
Forge</a>. And, a quick visit to that site reveals he was cited by the city
yesterday for taking up too much space. Boo on you City of Portland.
