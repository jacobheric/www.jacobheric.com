May took to the two wheeler this weekend, with great success. A big development
in life. I can still recall my first time on two wheels with great pride and joy
(and some pain as I didn't actually know how to use the brakes yet). Rosa got
into the act as well demonstrating her new love of reading chapter books!

Videos below the fold.
