We took in the fine views of the city at
[Fort Sumner Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Sumner_(Maine)) on the
East End of Portland. The park is the subject of some controversy of late as the
condo building bonanza in the hood threatens to eclipse the
[view](http://www.pressherald.com/2016/09/21/historic-preservation-board-asked-to-consider-landmark-status-for-fort-sumner-park/).
Given Portland's present building boom, the situation is unfortunately not
unusual.

It's a neat walk from the park down the steps to the tip of the Bayside
neighborhood that teems with new breweries, distilleries, cafes & restaurants.
There we slaked our thirst on Rising Tide's
[Gose](http://www.risingtidebrewing.com/pisces).
