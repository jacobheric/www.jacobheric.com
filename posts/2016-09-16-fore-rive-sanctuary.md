We took a long stroll through the
[Fore River Sanctuary](http://trails.org/our-trails/fore-river-sanctuary/) near
our house. On the way we hit the
[Capisic Park Pond](http://trails.org/our-trails/capisic-brook-trail/) which is
also lovely, and under major construction as of this writing. On the way we also
swung by the back door of [Overland Honey](http://www.overlandhoney.com/). Yum!.
On the way back we hit Jewel Falls, Portland's only water fall. Owing to the dry
summer, there wasn't much water falling.
