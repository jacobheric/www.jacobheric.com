The wife, 7 months pregnant, nurtured a month long cough into pneumonia and a two night stay in the hospital.  And, my right eye
doesn't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_serous_retinopathy">work</a>.  The wife is better and thanks to her mom, nana,
things actually went pretty smoothly around here while she was laid up.  I managed to put two fence posts in the ground the afternoon
the first snow storm rolled into town.  Which was good because the fence was leaning and the snow hasn't let up since.
