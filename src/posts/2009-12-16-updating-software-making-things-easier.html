title: updating software, making things easier

Rather than take responsibility for my lack of activity, I've decided to dump drupal (why is everything so complicated) and install wordpress.  I've moved over posts....images didn't come over so well...oh well....I may fix those as some point. We'll see if this makes it easier to add content.
