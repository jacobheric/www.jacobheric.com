Sometimes you head out to the grocery store, but you end up at the circus instead.  Whole foods had some circus festivities in support of a world record breaking cheese cutting event (sic).  It was fun.  Smart move on their part too.  It's a lot easier to stomach the prices on produce when they're plying you with free food and entertaining your kids.
