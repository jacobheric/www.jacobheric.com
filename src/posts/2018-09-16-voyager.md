I love everything about the [Voyager](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/index.html) mission. 
The transcendent hopefulness, the technological audacity, the sheer will to reach beyond ourselves. 
I jumped when I stumbled on a [kickstarter](https://ozmarecords.com/pages/voyager) to issue a vinyl replica 
of Voyager's [golden record](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/golden-record/) cargo.
