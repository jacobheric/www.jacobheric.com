title: Rock Out Portland!

We saw the Joy Formidable recently.  They really rock out live.  They're better live actually than on their records.  Funny thing though I've noticed at shows recently.  Nobody dances.  Well, almost nobody dances.  Most of the crowd just stands there stone still before the music as if they were watching it on you tube. The Joy Formidable skedaddled immediately after the show, no encore.  That happened at the last show I went to too.  I suspect that wouldn't have happened if the crowd were a little more into it.  C'mon Portland.  Rock out!
