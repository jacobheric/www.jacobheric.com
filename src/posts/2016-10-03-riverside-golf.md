Rare is the occasion that my wife joins me on the course. But I've gotten her out a few times this season at the local, laid back, muni: [Riverside Golf Course, Portland Maine](http://www.riversidegolfcourseme.com/){:rel="nofollow"}. It can be a bit slow out there, but if the crowd is too thick, you can always pick up and hit the great Riverside Grill. Good taps and good views.
