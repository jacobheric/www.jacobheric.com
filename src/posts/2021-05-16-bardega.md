One upside to the pandemic is the loosening of some of the stuffy and teetotaling regulations that heretofore 
governed our food and drink scene. Here the previously non-descript Mellen St. Market was allowed to punch a hole 
in it's wall, reinvent itself as a "Bardega", and serve alcohol for us to consume on the sidewalk. This would have been 
unthinkable prior to Covid.
