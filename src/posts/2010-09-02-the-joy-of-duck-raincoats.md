I picked up these raincoats at <a href="http://www.renys.com/">Renys</a> in Bath last week.  Reny's is great.  They've got tons of stuff for the kids.  I try to hit it every time I'm in Bath, which is usually about once a month or so as I do some sub-subcontractor work at the <a href="http://www.gdbiw.com/">Iron Works</a>.  I like Bath too.  It's a mix of cute & salt, which the sign below captures well.  As for the doorway?  I believe that is an entrance into another dimension.  I will enter it on my next visit and report back.  If you do not see a post here for a while, you can assume it did not go well.  

By the way, the raincoat pictures were taken at dinner at the <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/20503/?view=beerfly">Lion's Pride</a> in Brunswick on the way home from Bath.  For those counting at home, that brings the total of world class beer bars within shouting distance of my house to three, including <a href="http://novareresbiercafe.com/">Novare Res</a> and <a href="http://www.ebenezerspub.net/">Ebenezer's Pub</a> (who also own the Lion's Pride).  Ok, Ebenezer's is a little more than a shout away (from everything).
