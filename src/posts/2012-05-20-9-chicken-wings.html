Of all the things an American dad hopes to teach his daughter, a preternatural love of chicken wings (grilled buffalo in this case) is certainly in the top 5 (perhaps behind elite prep school attendance and ascendance to a federal judgeship).  Rosa hit a milestone on this track today, though she still lags behind her four year old sister, whose buffalo wing consumption is so prolific that I dare not blog about it.
