Every year, Portland has <a href="http://www.portlandmaine.com/walk-working-waterfront/" ref="nofollow">Walk the Working Waterfront</a> day. It's great, you get to see all the maritime things that aren't normally visible or open to the public (fish processors, the fire boat, the coast guard cutter, etc).
