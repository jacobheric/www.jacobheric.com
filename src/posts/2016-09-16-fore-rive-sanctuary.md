We took a long stroll through the [Fore River Sanctuary](http://trails.org/our-trails/fore-river-sanctuary/){:rel="nofollow"} near our house.
On the way we hit the [Capisic Park Pond](http://trails.org/our-trails/capisic-brook-trail/){:rel="nofollow"} which is also lovely, and under major construction as of this writing. On the way we also swung by the back door of [Overland Honey](http://www.overlandhoney.com/){:rel="nofollow"}. Yum!. On the way back we hit Jewel Falls, Portland's only water fall. Owing to the dry summer, there wasn't much water falling.
