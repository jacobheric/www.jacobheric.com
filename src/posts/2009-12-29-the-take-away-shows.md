It's hard to think of a better accompaniment to Kazuki Tomokawa than that boxer barking in the background.

I ran into The Take-Away Shows today on Vimeo while posting my christmas present home
<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/8388905">videos</a>. Vimeo posted their <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/album/159627/">25
favorite videos of the year</a>.  One of them was a <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/3814849">Sigur Ros video</a> from
the Take-Away Shows which lead me to the excellent
<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/channels/takeawayshows">Take-Away Shows Vimeo channel</a>. I then moved onto
the huge <a href="http://www.blogotheque.net/spip.php?page=cae_all&lang=en">archive</a> of The Take-Away Shows
at <a href="http://www.blogotheque.net/">La Blogoth√®que</a>.

I've only just begun to delve into them, but that archive and the vimeo channel are full of fine things.

Update, favorites so far:

- <a href="http://www.blogotheque.net/Beirut,3455">Beirut doing Nantes</a> amongst the garbage cans.
- <a href="http://www.blogotheque.net/Department-of-Eagles,3604">Department of Eagles</a> in NYC.
- <a href="http://www.blogotheque.net/Elvis-Perkins,3503">Elvis Perkins</a> in Paris.
- <a href="http://www.blogotheque.net/John-Vanderslice,3442">John Vanderslice doing White Dove</a> (third video) on a serene soccer field in Seattle, a strange place to hear that song.
