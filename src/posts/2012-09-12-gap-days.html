Mom's school started a couple weeks before Rosa's, so we had to get creative with kid coverage.  I took only a couple days (thanks to nana) but managed to cram the days so full of little adventures that it was a summer send-off to remember.  We rode bikes downtown (May's first big ride on the two wheeler...three miles).  Got Maine peaches and red plums at farmers market.  Went book shopping.  Baked a cake.  Made a chicken pot pie (Rosa's request).  Rode the city bus twice.  And, we squeezed in a trip the Thirsty Pig for beers and sausage!
