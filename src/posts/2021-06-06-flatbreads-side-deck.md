When the temperatures rise and the tourists descend, [Flatbread's](https://flatbreadcompany.com/locations/portland-me/) 
side deck is a strange oasis of calm and cool breezes. We like to sit and watch the ferry boats come and go, and the 
latest addition to the portland tourism scene, pedal-powered party boats, seen arriving in the background. In this shot, it is 
T-minus two minutes to a boatload of bridesmaids frantically disembarking in search of a place to pee.
